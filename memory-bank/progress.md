## Known Issues

1. Rate limiting needs production testing
2. AI response times can be optimized
3. Error handling can be improved
4. Need better feedback for AI operations

## Environment Setup

### Production Requirements

- OPENAI_API_KEY (for Groq)
- UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL
- UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN

### Development

- OPENAI_API_KEY (for Groq)
- In-memory rate limiting (no Redis required)

## Next Steps

1. Gather user feedback on AI features
2. Implement keyboard shortcuts
3. Add command palette for AI operations
4. Enhance error handling
5. Optimize AI response times
6. Add user feedback UI
7. Implement usage analytics
